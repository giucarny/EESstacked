# Preface 
This document consists in the codebook of a stacked data matrix (SDM) based on the dataset of the 2019 
European Election Studies (EES) voter study. The creation of this SDM is part of the research activities 
of [ProConEU](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/proconeu/), a research project aiming to analyse the 
enlarging gaps between proponents and opponents of the European Integration in terms of party politics, 
citizen politics, and social media communication. The project is funded by the German Federal Ministry 
of Education and Research (BMBF), and it involves the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research 
(MZES) of the University of Mannheim, the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, the University of
Thessaloniki, and the University of Newcastle.  
More specifically, this dataset is the product of the efforts of the ProConEU working package based at 
the MZES. The preparation of the 2019 EES SDM set was led by Hermann Schmitt and coordinated by Giuseppe 
Carteny. Wilhelmine Häußling, Julian Leiser, and Matthias Körnig actively participated to the 
realisation of both dataset and documentation. The data pipeline and workflow were completed between 
July 2021 and January 2022 making use of R [@r_cit], and are deposited in a online public repository 
available at [https://github.com/giucarny/EESstacked](https://github.com/giucarny/EESstacked).

# Introduction 

## The stacked data matrix

The stacked data matrix consists in a ...

## Original data file

The dataset from which the stacked data matrix (version 1) is computed is the 2019 European Election 
Study (EES) voter study (Schmitt et al. 2020). This study consists in a cross-national post-election 
survey, conducted by Gallup International in all 28 EU member states after the 2019 European 
Parliament elections. Respondents were selected randomly from access panel databases using 
stratification variables, with the exception of Malta and Cyprus where a multi-stage Random Digit 
Dialing (RDD) approach was used. In all countries, the samples were stratified by gender, age, region, 
and type of locality, and the sample size is roughly 1000 interviews in each EU member state (except 
Cyprus, Luxembourg, and Malta where the sample size is 500), with a total number of observations equal 
to 26,538. 




## Overview of the data file 

The variables of the dataset are grouped first according to their relationship with the set of variables 
available in the 2019 EES voter study. The first `r grep('countryname',names(EES2019_stckd))-1` 
variables consist in the original variables of said dataset, while the remaining 
`r length(EES2019_stckd)-(grep('countryname',names(EES2019_stckd))-1)` are variables computed from the 
former ones or, in a few cases, original ones. This codebook refers to the latter set.  

The variables computed for the SDM are then grouped as it follows: 

*  **Identification variables**: A set of variables computed in order to identify EES 2019 respondents',
their national contexts, the relevant parties of said contexts, and the dyadic relationships between 
respondents and relevant parties. Said variables do not share a common suffix;

*  **Recoded variables**: These variables consist in the building blocks of the generic variables 
presented below. More specifically they are recoded versions of a subset of variables included in 
the original 2019 EES voter study dataset^[The original 2019 EES voter study variables' coding is 
available on the
[2019 EES voter study Master Questionnaire](https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/download.asp?id=67447) and 
the [2019 EES voter study codebook](https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/download.asp?id=67448).]. Said 
variables are identified by the suffix `_rec`;

*  **Generic variables**: The variables represent the specific variables of the SDM. They concern the 
unit of analysis of the SDM approach, namely the dyadic relationship between each individual 
observation of the original data matrix (the 2019 EES voter study dataset) and each relevant party of a 
given party system. These variables share the suffix `_gen`. Generic variables are then subset in three 
distinct groups, namely *categorical*, *proximity*, and *synthetic* variables.

Political parties are considered "*relevant*" according to two criteria. First, if a 2019 EES voter 
study includes a propensity to vote (PTV) measure for a gven party, then said party is considered 
relevant. Second, if said party obtained at least one seat in the 2019 EP elections, the it will be 
considered relevant.

# Variables 
## Identification variables {-}

### party {-}
Unique identifier of the relevant parties participating to the European Parliament (EP) elections of 
2019. Only parties for which the EES 2019 voter study propensity to vote (PTV) variable is available 
have been selected. Values equate to those defined in the original EES 2019 vote choice variable 
referring to the 2019 EP elections 
(`Q7`; See the [2019 EES voter study codebook](https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/download.asp?id=67448)). 

### stack {-} 
Unique identifier combining the individual respondent identification code as assigned in the EES 2019 
voter study (`respid`; See the 
[2019 EES voter study codebook](https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/download.asp?id=67448)) (`respid`) and 
party codes (`party`). 

### countryname and countryshort {-}
The first variable (`countryname`) consists in the complete name of the European Union member states in 
2019, whereas the second variable (`countryshort`) consists in the two-letter country code of said 
states as defined by  
[Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Country_codes).
