The 2019 EES Stacked Data Matrix
================
2022-07-28

This repository contains the code for building the stacked data matrix
(SDM) of the 2019 European Election Studies
([EES](http://europeanelectionstudies.net/)) voter study. The creation
of this SDM is part of the research activities of the
[ProConEU](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/proconeu/) project, an
academic research effort[^1] analysing the enlarging gaps between
proponents and opponents of the European Union (EU) in terms of party
politics, citizen politics, and social media communication. The data
pipeline and workflow were mostly completed between July 2021 and
January 2022 making use of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) version
4.1-4.2.
